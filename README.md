This is common problem in frontend world - there is no generalized template, it's more like example even if is. This template is to try to provide solution, a code base to start from. It should be able to hold light, medium and somewhat large projects, offer structure and architecture, suggest some guidlines and articles to research more about frontend app building from the box.

## Guidelines
